# Is Japanese one of the hardest languages to learn?

---

# Yes

- Three writing systems.
- Over 2,000 characters required to read a newspaper.
- The grammar is totally different from English.
- Several politeness levels.

---

# No

- Presumably you enjoy Japanese media.
- No tricky pronounciation.
- Like how Yoda speaks, the grammar is.
- The writing systems are easier than they seem.
- You don't have to learn everything to achieve your goals.
- Who cares that it's difficult if you enjoy learning it?

# The Writing Systems

- **Hiragana (ひらがな)** Used to sound out words.　
- **Katakana (カタカナ)** Mostly used to sound out foreign loan words.
- **Kanji (漢字)** Picture characters used to convey meaning of a word.

---

# Hiragana & Katakana (kana)

- 46 characters.
- Each character represents a vowel sound.
- Some can be modified to create different sounds.
- Can be picked up 1 to 2 weeks with short daily study.
- Knowing them makes it easier to know how to pronounce a word - "emoji" vs 「えもじ」 😄
- Use a flashcard app to learn them (Memrise, etc).
- Try to practice reading real materials as you go.

# Kanji

- 2,136 jōyō (daily use) kanji as of 2010.
- Simple kanji depict a concept, for example 木 (tree).
- More complex kanji combine multiple symbols to represent an idea, for example 林 (woods), 森 (forest) and 休 (rest).
