# The Writing Systems

- **Hiragana (ひらがな)** Used to sound out words.　
- **Katakana (カタカナ)** Mostly used to sound out foreign loan words.
- **Kanji (漢字)** Picture characters used to convey meaning of a word.

# Hiragana & Katakana (kana)

- 46 characters.
- Each character represents a vowel sound.
- Some can be modified to create different sounds.
- Can be picked up 1 to 2 weeks with short daily study.
- Knowing them makes it easier to know how to pronounce a word - "emoji" vs 「えもじ」 😄
- Use a flashcard app to learn them (Memrise, etc).
- Try to practice reading real materials as you go.

# Kanji

- 2,136 jōyō (daily use) kanji.
- Increased from 1,945 in 2010.
- Required for basic adult literacy.
