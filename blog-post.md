I will be giving a talk at Kitacon 2017 about techniques for learning Japanese.
The main aim of the talk will of course be to be useful to the audience, but working
on the content for it got me thinking about the journey that lead to me first deciding
to start studying Japanese, the difference that it has made to my life and what I have
learned about myself in the process. Since one of my aims for this site is to not
just write about programming I thought it would be a good idea to write down some
of my thoughts.

I first decided to take a Japanese class in the autumn of 2008. I'd been getting into
tokusatsu and anime for a couple of years prior to that and one interesting side
effect was that it was the first time in my life that I'd had any real exposure to
a foreign language. My only previous language previous experience was five years of
secondary school French and quite early on in that process I'd written myself off
as somebody who is Just Not Good at Languages. As I began to pick up words from
the combination of context and subtitles the language itself became a point of
interest to me and I grew curious to learn more.

At the same time I was looking for something new to do that would get me out of
the house. From my early teens I had struggled with social anxiety, or something
to that effect, as well as a host of other personal problems. At that point in my
life I was 24 and I functioned, more or less. I had a job and did okay when it
came to day to day existing but I felt... I guess alien would be the word I'm
looking for. To this day it's hard to explain, probably because there were a
whole load of emotions bouncing arount my head that I didn't know how to begin
to process. I can look back and try to make statements about how I felt but
30-something me is in many ways a very different person with a very different
perspective. Signing up for that Japanese class felt like a small-ish thing at
the time.
