# Introduction

Good morning. This is "An Anime Fan's Guide to Learning Japanese" and I'm here to tell you how amazing learning Japanese is and share some tips and tricks to make it slightly less intimidating.

First, a little about me.

I started learning Japanese towards the end of 2008 and I think I've done pretty well with it in that time. At the time that I started I'd only been watching subtitled anime for about a year or so, and Super Sentai for a bit longer than that. Like lots of people do I'd picked up a few words here and there and this was the first time in my life I'd found myself interested by another language.

Out of curiosity I'd picked up a really basic book on learning Japanese from a local Waterstones and after reading the couple of chapters in a nearby Costa I never got much further in the book. Those first few chapters were an overview of the structure of the Japanese writing systems which I found fascinating, but after that it turned into pages and pages of stilted dialogue examples all written in romaji.

A few months later I started a Japanese evening class, which I then continued with for four years.
