# Introduction

Good morning.

This is "An Anime Fan's Guide to Learning Japanese" and I'm here to convince you that learning Japanese is a totally awesome thing to do as give you some tips and tricks to make it all slightly less intimidating.

First, a little about me.

So I've been learning Japanese for nine years now and when I first started my only reasons were to watch untranslated anime and tokusatsu and to meet people who were into the same things as me.

The first thing I did was na√Øvely pick up some "Teach yourself Japanese" book from Waterstones and at that point I was so motivated that I went straight to a nearby Costa and read the first few chapters. They were fascinating, because they were an overview of how the writing systems work, the rest of the book ... maybe not so much. The last few chapters might have been amazing, I've no idea since I never got much further, but it seemed like most of the book was endless pages of dry dialogue examples written in romaji. I tried to pick the book up again a few times but after a while I just stopped bothering.

So the next thing I tried was looking for Japanese evening classes, and eventually enrolled in one that a local uni was running. At the time that was probably the best decision I could have made because I suddenly became super determined to do well.

So yeah enough about me. Let's talk about why you want to you might want to learn Japanese...
