# Learn Hiragana

Hiragana is the set of 51 characters that make up the most basic building block of written Japanese. There are a couple of reasons why learning them should be one of the first things that you do:

1. Understanding hiragana makes learning Japanese simpler. Each character represents one sound and only one sound, which means that once you have learned them you will always be able to tell how a word should be pronounced. Learning Japanese from romaji on the other hand can be confusing because there are multiple ways that a word could be written and the correct pronunciation may not be obvious.
2. Being able to read and write hiragana is one of the first clear goals that you can set for yourself. Achieving this victory is a great feeling and makes you more likely to keep going.

## How to learn hiragana.

- Believe in the me that believes in you!
- You can easily find a hiragana chart on the internet. Print one and put it somewhere you'll see it often.
- The characters are structured in groups of 5 or 3 based on the sounds they represent. Take 15 - 30 minutes to learn each day to learn one new group.
- Quiz yourself on the characters you've already learned whenever you have the chance.
- Grab some simple reading materials (for instance basic kana text books) and start trying to read individual words.
- Practice writing hiragana by hand.
- Learn how to use Japanese input on your computer and phone.
- Hiragana flashcard apps are also a great way to go. There are apps out there that were built just for learning hiragana or there are more general memorisation apps like Memrise and Anki.

# Learn Katakana

Katakana is the set of characters mainly used to sound out loan words from other languages including English. As with hiragana there are 51 characters representing the same sounds. Katakana isn't as useful to learn as hiragana so it's up to you whether you want to skip this step for now.

Understanding Katakana will allow you to understand the rules behind how English words are pronounced in Japanese, there are a couple of benefits to this:

1. Even with limited Japanese knowledge, if you go to Japan you're more likely to be understood if you can sound out English words the way a Japanese person would then if you just pronounced them normally.
2. Once you can read katakana and sound out words in your head there lots of reading comprehension that you basically get for free. Most places you see katakana you will probably be able to read it without having to look anything up.

## How to learn Katakana

- Use the same methods you used to learn hiragana.
- For additional practice think about how you would sound out any English words using katakana.
- Learn to write your own name.
- もう一度、お前を信じる俺を信じろ！

# Learn Vocab

With a general hiragana

Japanese sentence structure is very different to English, it is often described as being a bit like how Yoda speaks "At the end, the verb is". There's a bit more to but that's a pretty good intro.

Depending on how much time and or money you have available there are different

An important thing to bear in mind is that taking an English sentence and translating it into Japanese word by word will lead to unnatural results. Because of this it's important to spend as much time as possible listening to and reading natural Japanese. Watching anime can be quite an advantage here because once you get the grasp of.

# Step Four. Start Learning Kanji

Kanji are Chinese pictographic characters that have been adapted for use in Japanese. As of 2010 there are 2,136 'daily use' kanji. These are the characters that are taught in Japanese schools and being able to read and write these characters is considered the baseline for adult literacy.

Approaching learning kanji for the first time can be very intimidating. Apart from the sheer number of complex characters, many also have multiple meanings and readings, and most can be combined to create compound words.

Thankfully there are ways to manage the difficulty. First off, don't try to learn kanji in isolation. Unlike hiragana and katakana this is not at all a manageable goal. Instead it makes sense to start learning characters as you learn the words that they make up.
