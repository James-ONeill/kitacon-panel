# Step One. Learn Hiragana

Hiragana is the set of 51 characters that make up the most basic building block of written Japanese. There are a couple of reasons why learning them should be one of the first things that you do:

1. Understanding hiragana makes learning Japanese simpler. Each character represents one sound and only one sound, which means that once you have learned them you will always be able to tell how a word should be pronounced. Learning Japanese from romaji on the other hand can be confusing because there are multiple ways that a word could be written and the correct pronunciation may not be obvious.
2. Being able to read and write hiragana is one of the first clear goals that you can set for yourself. Achieving this victory is a great feeling and makes you more likely to keep going.

## How to learn hiragana.

- Believe in the me that believes in you!
- You can easily find a hiragana chart on the internet. Print one and put it somewhere you'll see it often.
- The characters are structured in groups of 5 or 3 based on the sounds they represent. Take 15 - 30 minutes to learn each day to learn one new group.
- Quiz yourself on the characters you've already learned whenever you have the chance.
- Grab some simple reading materials (for instance basic kana text books) and start trying to read individual words.
- Hiragana flashcard apps are also a great way to go. There are apps out there that were built just for learning hiragana or there are more general memorisation apps like Memrise and Anki.
