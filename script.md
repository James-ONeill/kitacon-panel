# Introduction

Good morning. This is "An Anime Fan's Guide to Learning Japanese" and I'm here to tell you how amazing learning Japanese is and share some tips and tricks to make it slightly less intimidating.

First, a little about me.

I started learning Japanese towards the end of 2008 and I think I've done pretty well with it in that time. When I started I'd only been watching Japanese language media for a couple of years. Like lots of people do I'd picked up a few words here and there and this was the first time in my life I'd found myself interested by another language.

Out of curiosity I'd picked up a really basic book on learning Japanese from a local Waterstones and after reading the couple of chapters in a nearby Costa I never got much further in the book. Those first few chapters were an overview of the structure of the Japanese writing systems which I found fascinating, but after that it turned into pages and pages of lifeless dialogue examples all written in romaji with no real guidance on how to actually learn the language.

A few months later I started a Japanese evening class. While did want to learn the lanaguage I also didn't have much of a social life at the time and I thought that doing a Japanese class would be a way to meet people who were into the same things as me.

That last part didn't quite work out as I'd hoped but taking the class did make me more motivated to study Japanese properly. Rather than just going along with the lessons I started doing more independent learning. I read course materials ahead of time and then started looking for other learning resources.
